TREE AND VARIANTS EXERCISES

1) Problem

Is It A BST
Given a binary tree, check if it is a binary search tree (BST). A valid BST does not have to be complete or balanced.

Consider this definition of a BST:

All nodes values of left subtree are less than or equal to parent node value.
All nodes values of right subtree are greater than or equal to parent node value.
Both left subtree and right subtree must be BSTs.
NULL tree is a BST.
Single node trees (including leaf nodes of any tree) are BSTs.
Example One
Example one

Output:

0
Left child value 200 is greater than the parent node value 100; violates the definition of BST.

Example Two
Example two

Output:

1
Notes
Return true if the input tree is a BST or false otherwise.
Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes <= 100000
-109 <= values stored in the nodes <= 109



2) Problem

Single Value Tree
Given a binary tree, find the number of unival subtrees. An unival (single value) tree is a tree that has the same value in every node.

Example One
Example one

Output:

6
The input tree has a total of 6 nodes. Each node is a root of a subtree. All those 6 subtrees are unival trees.

Example Two
Example two

Output:

5
The input tree has a total of 7 nodes, so there are 7 subtrees. Of those 7, all but two subtrees are unival. The two non-unival subtrees are:

The one rooted in the root node and
The one rooted in the root's right child.
Notes
Constraints:

0 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 105
-109 <= node value <= 109
