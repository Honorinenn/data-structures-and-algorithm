Count Islands
Given a two-dimensional matrix of 0s and 1s, find the number of islands.

An island is a group of connected 1s or a standalone 1. A cell in the matrix can be connected to up to 8 neighbors: 2 vertical, 2 horizontal and 4 diagonal.

Example
{
"matrix": [
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
]
}
Output:

5
Notes
Use as little extra memory as possible.
Solve the problem without allocating a visited matrix.
Constraints:

1 <= number of rows <= 450
