1)  Problem

Count Islands
Given a two-dimensional matrix of 0s and 1s, find the number of islands.

An island is a group of connected 1s or a standalone 1. A cell in the matrix can be connected to up to 8 neighbors: 2 vertical, 2 horizontal and 4 diagonal.

Example
{
"matrix": [
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
[1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
]
}
Output:

5
Notes
Use as little extra memory as possible.
Solve the problem without allocating a visited matrix.
Constraints:

1 <= number of rows <= 450
1 <= number of columns <= 450




2)  Problem


Find Largest Island
Given a two-dimensional grid of 0s and 1s, find the size of the largest island. If there is no island return 0.

An island is a group of 1s connected vertically or horizontally.

Example One
{
"grid": [
[1, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 0],
[0, 0, 1]
]
}
Output:

4
There are two islands:

[(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
[(2, 2)]
Size of the largest (first) island is 4.

Example Two
{
"grid": [
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]
]
}
Output:

0
Notes
Constraints:

1 <= number of rows <= 200
1 <= number of columns <= 200
